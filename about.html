        <h3>We're Daan and Danny</h3>
         <p>
           At the moment we are students at the Hochschule technik und wirtschaft located in Berlin.
           We are studying international media and computing, which is very interesting.
           While working at the computer we do sit alot. In order to stay fit we need to do sport and eat well.
           Thatswhy we are starting a blog about food. At this website you will get information about Food,
           why it´ts good not to eat much meat and you can give us feedback or contact us on our contact formular. 
           we hope you enjoy our website. If you like it, it would be nice from you if you tell your friends or family about it! :-)
